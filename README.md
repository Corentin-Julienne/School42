# 42 School Projects and Exams

## 🗣️ About
---

[School 19](https://campus19.be/) and more generally schools of the [42 network](https://www.42network.org/) aims to teach CS and programation through project completion. In other words, every student will have to complete and validate 15+ CS projects in order to finish the school common core.

It allows the student to develop essential skills to work in the IT industry such as autonomy, rigor, teamwork, and the ability to never give up. Indeed, for every project you will have to find the solution by yourself or with other students, without the help of a teacher or staff.
